This directory is ready for screenshots.

Run `npm run screenshots` locally to generate the actual screenshot images.

Note: The screenshot capture script requires:
- Running Angular application (npm start)
- Docker services (SQL Server, Redis, etc.)
- Initialized and seeded database

These dependencies are not available in the CI/CD environment, so screenshots
must be generated and committed from a local development environment.
