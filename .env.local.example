# Local Development Environment Configuration
# This file is a template for creating your .env.local file
# Copy this file to .env.local and adjust values as needed
# DO NOT commit .env.local to version control - it's for local development only

# ============================================================================
# MOCKED LOCAL DEVELOPMENT (DEFAULT)
# ============================================================================
# By default, all services are mocked in-memory when NODE_ENV=development:
# - SQLite (in-memory) replaces SQL Server
# - MemoryCache (in-memory) replaces Redis
# - MockSignalR (in-memory) replaces Azure SignalR
# - MockEventHub (in-memory) replaces Azure Event Hubs
#
# No additional configuration needed! Just run:
# npm run start:dev

NODE_ENV=development

# ============================================================================
# OPTIONAL: Testing with Real Azure Services
# ============================================================================
# To test with real Azure services, you must ALSO change NODE_ENV to something
# other than "development" (the mocks are only active when NODE_ENV=development).
#
# Note: Backend configuration (connection strings) should be set in 
# apps/backend/local.settings.json, not here. This file is for client-side
# configuration only.

# Kendo UI License Key (required for both local dev and production)
# Obtain your license key from https://www.telerik.com/account/
# 
# Local Development: Set this value in .env.local (this file)
# GitHub Actions CI/CD: Set as repository secret named KENDO_UI_LICENSE
# Azure DevOps CI/CD: Add to variable group 'assetsim-prod-vars' and mark as secret
# 
# If not configured, Kendo UI will run in trial mode with watermarks
KENDO_UI_LICENSE=your-kendo-license-key-here
